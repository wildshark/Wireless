# WiFi Voucher Authentication

WiFi voucher authentication is a cloud-based authentication method offered to schools and businesses for managing guest WiFi access. With this system, WiFi clients are granted temporary Internet access for a specified period using unique codes generated as vouchers. These vouchers can be distributed via SMS or email to customers, allowing them to connect to the WiFi network.

## Key Features

- **Secure and Individual Access**: Each WiFi client receives a unique voucher code, ensuring that only authorized users can access the Internet.

- **Temporary Access**: Vouchers have a predefined validity period, after which they expire, providing controlled access to the network.

- **Easy Distribution**: Vouchers can be sent to customers via SMS or email, simplifying the onboarding process for users.

- **Enhanced Security**: WiFi voucher authentication offers stronger security compared to using shared passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

- **Flexible Management**: The cloud-based nature of the system enables easy management and monitoring of voucher usage.

## How it Works

1. **Voucher Generation**: Administrators generate unique voucher codes with specific validity periods.

2. **Distribution**: Vouchers are distributed to users via SMS or email.

3. **User Onboarding**: WiFi clients use the received voucher code to connect to the WiFi network.

4. **Authentication**: The system validates the voucher code, granting temporary Internet access to the user.

5. **Expiry**: After the validity period, the voucher code becomes invalid, and the user's access is revoked.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can connect to the WiFi network seamlessly using their unique voucher codes.

- **Controlled Access**: The system allows administrators to control access duration, minimizing network abuse.

- **Reduced IT Burden**: Automated voucher generation and distribution reduce the need for manual intervention.

- **Visitor Insights**: The system provides insights into visitor usage patterns and demographics.

- **Scalability**: Suitable for managing WiFi access in various environments, including schools, hotels, cafes, and public venues.

## Getting Started

To implement WiFi voucher authentication in your organization, follow the steps outlined in the documentation:

1. Set up the cloud-based WiFi voucher authentication system.

2. Configure voucher generation settings, including validity periods and other access parameters.

3. Integrate the system with your existing WiFi infrastructure or access points.

4. Customize the voucher distribution process based on your preferred method (SMS or email).

5. Monitor and manage voucher usage through the administration portal.
